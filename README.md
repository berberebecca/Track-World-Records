# Track-World-Records
#
In honor of the ongoing Olympics I wanted to take a closer look at the world records within the running disciplines.
The athletes of which disciplines are constantly beating their records, where is a plateau?

In this project the main challenge was the data cleaning. I scraped multiple tables of wikipedia but had to unite and therefore clean them (a lot).
Since this seems to be very much part of the daily journalism practice I am happy that I got to practice it. The focus of this project therefore was 
more on the analytics and the cleaning.

First I wanted to get the data of a pdf from World Athletics but the pdf was just text and therefore hard to grab. This is why I used Wikipedia and 
cross-checked with World Records after.

Instead of ai2html, which I used in previous projects for scrolly-telling, I used a jpeg-template for this one. I initially wanted to use/make 
interactive Visuals, but the deadline was to close and I think the point also very much gets across with these graphs.
